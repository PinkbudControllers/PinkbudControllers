<h2 style="font-size:250%;">1. About me</h2>

<h2 style="font-size:250%;">5. Detailed information about all products</h2>
 <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>New in Box Nintendo Gamecube Controller (Smash Logo, Black): 50€</b> </p>
      <p> <img src="oem.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="oem2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">All controllers are imported from Japan and are the Super Smash bros. special Edition that released with the Nintendo Switch in 2018. Apart from the Language on the Box, they are identical to the ones that released in Europe and the USA around the same time. These are the most recent straight up Gamecube Controllers Nintendo has released and therefore are the premium choice for Gamecube enthusiasts even almost a decade later.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Phob 2.0.5. Motherboard Replacement (Firmware Version 0.29): 25€ solo, 50€ installed</b> </p>
<p> <img src="phob.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">The PhobGCC is an open source, community created PCB replacement for Gamecube Controllers. The biggest feature of a PhobGCC are the hall effect sticks that replace notoriously short lived stick potentiometers with magnets to vastly increase durability and precision. On top of that, there are many settings and options like snapback filters, button swapping, trigger modes and many more, that can be adjusted without opening the controller.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">To build a full Phob, you need a working Gamecube Controller (Should have T3 stickboxes), a PhobGGC PCB, 4 D1H1 Magnets + Holders and cables to attach the C-Stick PCB. SOLDERING IS REQUIRED TO BUILD A PHOB.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">If you order a preinstalled PhobGCC, it will be fully installed and calibrated so the controller is ready to play out of the box.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">If you order the individual board, you will receive and empty PhobGCC board, Magnets + Holders and a 6 Pin ribbon cable. You need to provide all other tools and materials yourself.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">You can find a guide how to build a PhobGCC <a href="https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-doc/blob/main/For_Makers/Build_Guide_2.0.md">here</a>.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">And a full list of functions including the commands to change them <a href="https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-doc/blob/main/For_Users/Phob_Calibration_Guide_Latest.md">here</a>.</p>
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Input Integrity Lossless USB Adapter for Gamecube Controllers (black, without USB Cable): 40€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="lossless.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">These high quality Adapters offer the best out of the box performance of any USB Gamecube Controller Adapter. It´s completely plug and play but offers even more features like button remapping and lag testing. </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">You need a USB-A to USB-C cable to connect this adapter to your device.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">These adapters are not produced by Nintendo but instead they are developed and produced by <a href="https://x.com/SSBM_Arte">Arte</a>. You can find all the information regarding the adapter as well as Artes shop at <a href="https://www.input-integrity.com/">Input Integrity</a>.</p>
 <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Nintendo Gamecube Controller Adapter, used (tested and working): 30€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="adap1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="adap2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="adap3.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">An official Nintendo Gamecube Controller to USB adapter.  Needed to connect your Gamecube controller to many devices like a PC, Switch, WiiU or even your phone and many more! Works with all types of gamecube controllers with the standard console-side plug.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">These are second hand and sold without original packaging but are tested and in perfect working condition.</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Sparkplate (Notched Frontshell for Gamecube Controllers): 35€</b> </p>
       <p> <img src="sparkrosa.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="sparkblack.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="sparkgruen.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="sparkblue.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="sparkred.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">Injection molded, fully notched replacement front shells for Nintendo Gamecube Controllers (NO BACKSHELL INCLUDED). They fit on any OEM Nintendo Gamecube Controller but are only recommended and meant to be used with sticks that can be calibrated (i.e. phobs and similar). The notches have to be calibrated after installing the frontshell, you can find a guide to so <a href="https://github.com/PhobGCC/PhobGCC-doc/blob/main/For_Users/Phob_Calibration_Guide_Latest.md">here</a>.</p>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">These are NOT official OEM parts but are instead distributed by <a href="https://www.sparkplatemelee.com/">Spark</a>. They are a little more finnicky to install than OEM shells and some third party Buttons or Sticks might need some work to funciton perfectly. </p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Trigger Plugs (Full and Half): 1€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="plugs1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="plugs3.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="plugs2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Trigger Plugs are 3D printed plastic pins that can be inserted into the cylindrical hole inside the Trigger.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">They shorten the distance between the trigger itself and the trigger daughterboards that are responsible for the digital input (fullshield in melee)</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Full trigger plugs skip the analogue portion of the trigger input completely. You get an instant fullshield in melee.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Half trigger plugs shorten the analogue portion of the trigger inut. You get ligthshield into a faster fullshield in melee</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;"><b>IMPORTANT IF YOU PLAY ULTIMATE:</b> Full trigger plugs only work on Phobs, not on OEM. If you want full plugs on a phob and plan on playing ultimate, you need to notify me in the order form or the shield will not work in game.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Tactile Z button (100gram or 150gram resistance): 3€ solo, 5€ installed</b> </p>
<p> <img src="tac100.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="tac150.jpg" width="400" height="400">  </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">Replaces the original internal Z button on a gamecube controller for one with a more "clicky" haptical feedback. Available in two resistances:</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>1x OMRON 100g Tactile Switch:</b> Requires average force to press</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>1x OMRON 150g Tactile Switch:</b> Requires above average force to press (still reasonable, personally I prefer these)</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">When using a custom Z button without the metal spring, it is recommended to add a tactile Z button to make up for the missing resistance from the spring.</p>
      <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>OEM Z button replacement: 5€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="oemz.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">Unused parts harvested from brand new Smash Ultimate controllers.</p>
       <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>OEM T3 Stickbox (used): 5€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="stickbox1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="stickbox2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">These used official T3 Stickboxes are taken either from Gamecube Controllers or Wii Nunchuks and are cleaned and lubricated prior to delivery. They can be used as replacements on any controller that originally comes with T3 stickboxes and are widely considered the best stickboxes for the Nintendo Gamecube Controller.</p>
 <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Replacement Noble Stick Potentiometers: 2€</b> </p>
  <p> <img src="potis.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">Harvested from brand new Smah Ultimate Controllers, these are unused OEM parts. Soldering is required to install them.</p>
      <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>OEM Nintendo Nunchuk Stick (used): 5€</b> </p>
<p> <img src="nunchuksticks1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="nunchuksticks2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">Harvested from official Wii Nunchuks, these come with the same connector as Gamecube Controllers so they perfectly fit without any modification. The dome of the Stick (the rubber part) sits a little higher than an OEM Gamecube Stick, this might take some time to get used to.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The sticks all work perfectly well and have no cracks or visible damage. There are varying degrees of yellowing but all the rubbers are completely intact and not sticky or degraded.</p>
 <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Detachable Paracord and cable adapters: Complete new OEM Cable + detachable paracord mod:45€, 35€ detachable paracord mod, 5€ detachable OEM cable mod</b> </p>
<p> <img src="para1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="para2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="para3.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">Originally used in aviation as parachute lines, these woven nylon ropes are flexible, durable and stretchable to an extend. This, and the fact they are available in many different colors and designs make them an optimal choice to sleeve the cable of a controller. The original rubber shielding is removed and replaced with the outter part of the paracord.</p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">The <i>detachable</i> refers to the Controller side plug of the cable. Instead of soldering the 6 pins right to the board, the pins are inserted into an adapter that can be installed and deinstalled from the motherboard without the need for any tools! This allows to change and swap for all cables with a detchable plug at ease.</p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">These adapters can also be applied to OEM cables if you wanna future proof your controller. If you do not want a paracord but still want a detachable plug installed, please specify so in the order form.</p>
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Custom Buttons and Sticks: buttons 25€, sticks 10€ (set of 2) </b> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">The buttons are resin cast in silicon molds that have been taken directly from OEM buttons/balded OEM buttons. This ensures the buttons feel as close to actual OEM buttons as possible. Please consider, they can still feel a little different because of small incosistancies in the material of the button or the rubber pad.</p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">Available as regular OEM shape (1:1 copies) or balded (1:1 base profile, rounded, smooth top)</p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">The sticks are made in the same way and are full resin: Their shape is a 1:1 copy of OEM sticks but they do not have a rubber top. This <b>greatly</b> increases durability but might take some time to adept to the different texture. </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">I do not stock Buttons and Sticks as of now, they are all made to order. If you want to order Buttons and/or sticks, reach out to me through discord or per Email and describe the look you want. You can also send me an inspiration album of buttons and sticks you like or just send me the Hexcode to your favorite color and describe how you want me to incorporate it.</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Protective Controller Case: 20€</b> </p>
      <p> <img src="case.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="caseopen.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
  <p style="font-size:160%;">These are brand new protective cases made to fit Nintendo Gamecube Controllers. There is a zippable compartment inside and a foam cutout for the controller so it doesn´t shake around in there while carrying it around.</p>
    <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Budget Protective Controller Case: 10€</b> </p>
       <p> <img src="case1.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="case2.jpg" width="400" height="400"> <img src="case3.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
       <p style="font-size:160%;">Brand new protective cases, a little smaller and less optimized for Gamecube Controllers than the premium ones. These do not have a foam inlay to secure the controller in place so the controller can shake around in the closed case a little. </p>
  <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Triwing Y0 Scredriver: 2€</b> </p>
 <p> <img src="triwing.jpg" width="400" height="400"> </p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">This Screwdriver is needed to open the 6 screws holding together a Nintendo Gamecube Controller shell.</p>
