<p style="font-size:160%;">Hello and welcome! My name is Sebi, I entered the melee scene as a competitor in early 2022 and go by the tag <i>Pinkbud</i>. Some of you might already know me as the TO of the Berlin quarterly <i>Pause</i> events, for my involvement in other German tournament bangers like <i>Kornspeicher</i> and <i>Sapf</i> or from 3AM ranked sessions - ggs. </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">I got into modding controllers through the local community, started with very simple button swaps or stick replacements and learned more skills and techniques over time. However, there are many modifications and customisations I can not yet market. These include: Notches, Mouseclick anything, Snapback Capacitors and more.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:250%;">5. Detailed information about all products</h2>
 <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>New in Box Nintendo Gamecube Controller (Smash Logo, Black)</b> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">All controllers are imported from Japan and are the Super Smash bros. special Edition that released with the Nintendo Switch in 2018. Apart from the Language on the Box, they are identical to the ones that released in Europe and the USA around the same time. These are the most recent straight up Gamecube Controllers Nintendo has released and therefore are the premium choice for Gamecube Controllers even almost a decade later.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Phob 2.0.5. Motherboard Replacement (Firmware Version 0.29)</b> </p>
   <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Nintendo Gamecube Controller Adapter, used (tested and working)</b> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">An official Nintendo Gamecube Controller to USB adapter.  Needed to connect your Gamecube controller to many devices like a PC, Switch, WiiU or even your phone and many more! Works with all types of gamecube controllers with the standard console-side plug.</p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">These are second hand and sold without original packaging but are tested and in perfect working condition.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Trigger Plugs (Full and Half)</b> </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Trigger Plugs are 3D printed plastic pins that can be inserted into the cylindrical hole inside the Trigger.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">They shorten the distance between the trigger itself and the trigger daughterboards that are responsible for the digital input (fullshield in melee)</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Full trigger plugs skip the analogue portion of the trigger input completely. You get an instant fullshield in melee.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">Half trigger plugs shorten the analogue portion of the trigger inut. You get ligthshield into a faster fullshield in melee</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">IMPORTANT IF YOU PLAY ULTIMATE: Full trigger plugs only work on Phobs, not on OEM. If you want full plugs on a phob and plan on playing ultimate, you need to notify me in the order form or the shield will not work in game.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Stabilised Buttons and Triggers</b> </p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">For this mod, small pieces of low friction tape are applied around the gates of the face buttons and/or triggers. This reduces the wiggle of the buttons inside the shell and makes for a more direct press.</p>
<p style="font-size:160%;">The effect of this mod is subtle and you can´t achieve zero wiggle without hindering the buttons from moving smoothly. A little bit of play will always be left.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Tactile Z button (100gram or 150gram resistance)</b> </p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">Replaces the original internal Z button on a gamecube controller for one with a more "clicky" haptical feedback. Available in two resistances:</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>1x OMRON 100g Tactile Switch:</b> Requires average force to press</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;"><b>1x OMRON 150g Tactile Switch:</b> Requires above average force to press (still reasonable, personally I prefer these)</p>
    <p style="font-size:160%;">When using custom buttons without the metal Spring, it is recommended to add a tactile Z button to make up for the missing resistance from the spring.</p>
     <p style="font-size:200%;"> <b>Detachable Paracord and cable adapters</b> </p>
     <p style="font-size:160%;">Originally used in aviation as parachute lines (therefore the name "para"-cord), these woven nylon ropes are flexible, durable and stretchable to an extend. This, and the fact they are available in many different colors and designs make them an optimal choice to sleeve the cable of a controller. The original rubber shielding is removed and replaced with the outter part of the paracord.</p>
      <p style="font-size:160%;">The <i>detachable</i> refers to the Controller side plug of the cable. Instead of soldering the 6 pins right to the board, the pins are inserted into an adapter that can be installed and deinstalled from the motherboard without the need for any tools! This allows to change and swap for all cables with a detchable plug at ease.</p>
 <p style="font-size:160%;">These adapters can also be applied to OEM cables if you wanna future proof your controller. If you do not want a paracord but still want a detachable plug installed, please specify so in the order form.</p>
